                <p class="txt">Ben Solo, a character played by actor Adam Driver since Star Wars 7: The Force Awakens released in our theaters in December 2015. This character coming straight from the galaxy far, far away that is Star Wars, is today part of one of the most appreciated characters by the fans who have both loved his development as well as the interpretation delivered by the actor. However, his fate decided for the last episode of the saga, Star Wars 9 The Rise of Skywalker, has divided the fans a lot and for most of them, they ask more than anything to have the chance to see him on screen again one day.

                    The Finalizer was a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer produced by Kuat-Entralla Engineering for the First Order Navy. Its design was inspired by the Imperial-class star destroyers of the Galactic Empire. It was placed under the command of General Armitage Hux. Captain Phasma and the FN Division were stationed aboard the Finalizer.
